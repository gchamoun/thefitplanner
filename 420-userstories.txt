As an admin, I would like to restrict certain items to students taking certain courses.

As an admin, I would like to see historical data about which items are being checked out for courses.

As a student, I would like to check out an item.
  0. Student views current inventory online
  1. Student worker logs into phone app
  2. Student walks up to the physical location where all the items are kept
  3. Student worker says hi, what is your name?
  4a. Student says I don't have an account. Student worker directs student to create an account
  4b. Student worker types in the name given which searches through list of users for the student receiving the item
  5. Student worker scans item(s), clicks next
  6. Student worker asks student to confirm which class they are taking. Student worker verifies that item(s) are allowed for that course.
  7. Student worker sets a date due (possibly based on default weekend value)
  8. Student worker hands student phone or tablet with liability waiver including
     list of classes that student must be part of in order to check out that item.
  9. Student signs liability and clicks finish
  
[At this point, a row with all pertinent data
 is inserted into reservations table:
    user_id (student who is receiving item)
    worker_checkout_id (student worker id)
    datecheckout (generated as current timestamp)
    datecreated (same as datecheckout)
    waiversignature]

[Additionally, one or more rows are inserted into the
 reservation_details table containing the following info:
    reservation_id
    item_id
    datedue
    course_id]
